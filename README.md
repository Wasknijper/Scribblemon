Scribblemon
===========

Started as a project for my Programming class, but I'm continue develop it! http://scribblemon.net


Working on now
==============

- Making a document outline for my new features, what edits I need to make and wich new variables I should add
- Drawing the evolutions of all the pokemon currently in the game.
- Fleshing out my catch Pokemon-idea.


Future content
==============

-    Evolutions, debating whenether to use an overlay with an animation, or a button in the menu bar.

-    Catching Pokemon, pokeballs would drop at random, higher lvl areas drop better pokeballs. If the lvl difference between you and the opponent is bigger the higher your catch rate. Possibly a mini-game to "catch" it with your mouse?

-   Party bonuses, having a certain type of Pokémon in your non-active party (so 5 total) the Pokémon that is out gets a small boost.

-   Pokemon Storage, storage space would increase every X and you can only catch pokemon not in your storage or active party, maybe add an exception for mudkip, cause you never have enough mudkips. Storage space would be permanent.

-    Location Exploring. Every attack you move in a bit further, if you go deeper you find different pokemon with slightly higher lvls, maybe even a small chance for a legendary at the end?

-    Gyms, each badge lets the game iddle better, ie, first badge lets your active pokemon attack every 10 seconds, 2nd badge 9 seconds, or increase storage space. Maybe both?

-   Regions, but I was thinking of combining this with prestige. Ie: you can only move to a new region if you get all the badges and train X amount of pokemon to lvl 100. Going to a new region lets you keep half of your badge iddling time. (Ie, if your pokemon attacks once every second at the end of the Kanto region, and you decide to go to Jotho, your new pokemon will attack once every 2 second until you get new badges

- Legendary Blessing, a very small chance that a random legendary appears that gives you a boost for a certain amount of time, or hinders you if its an "evil" legendary like darkai.

-    Trainer Points, every Pokemon you train to lvl 100 gets you a trainer point, wich you can use to upgrade yourself to increase your catch rate, attack power of Pokemon, chance to find legendaries and other stuff? Or maybe add items like Exp-share, lucky egg, focus sash, bike ect.

-    Pokédex, probably filtered by region, maybe give some info when you caught them?

- Trainer Battles, random chance a trainer asks for a battle? Gets you more exp and some trainer points?

- Achievements! Congrats you finished reading the README.md!
